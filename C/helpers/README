  ->Description: Generates input file acceptable by parser from the image that is to be loaded
    in tensor. The file format is as follows.

    ->row_major is also an integer specified as follows
        1:row major arrangement in tensor.
        0:column major arrangement in tensor.
    ->image_file_name specifies the file path for the source image.
    ->csv_file_name specifies the path for the file to be written.Note that an empty file must be created before specifying the path.
    
 2)def genImgFromOutputFile(csv_file_name):
    ->Description: Takes the above mentioned format file removes the first 4 rows and converts rest of the pixel values back
      to png image.
    ->csv_file_name specifies the path of the file from which image is to be generated.
