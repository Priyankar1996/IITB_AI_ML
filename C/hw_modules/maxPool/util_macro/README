Test_maxpool.c is used to test the function declared in ../include/maxPoolOfTensors.h .
It takes the parameters as user-inputs, fill in sequential/random data and gives a function call to maxPoolOfTensors() with these parameters. It compares the output with another maxPooled tensor computed using GNU Octave, and prints if there are differences in the outputs.

Input-format:
	On NEW lines, specify (in the given order):
		Sequential (0) or random (1) data 
		Pool_size (l)
		Stride (s)
		Size of vector across each dims ( = Num_dims_of_input different inputs. Begin each input on a NEW line)
