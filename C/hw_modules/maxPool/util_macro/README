Test_maxpool.c is used to test the function declared in ../include/maxPoolOfTensors.h .
It takes the parameters as user-inputs, fill in sequential/random data and gives a function call to maxPoolOfTensors() with these parameters. It compares the output with another maxPooled tensor computed using GNU Octave, and prints if there are differences in the outputs.

Input-format:
	On NEW lines, specify (in the given order):
		Sequential (0) or random (1) data 
		Row_major_form (0/1)(1 for row_major)
		Num_dims_of_input
		Size of vector across each dims ( = Num_dims_of_input different inputs. Begin each input on a NEW line)
		Pool_size (l)
		Stride (s)
		Mode (0 = floor, 1 = ceiling)
		Num_dims_to_pool
		Dims_to_pool ( = Num_dims_of_pool different inputs. Begin each input on a NEW line). Each of them will lie b/w 0 and Num_dims_of_input )
