Instructions for compiling tests for different modules

maxPoolOfTensors:
	Run command "./maxPoolOfTensors.sh"
	This will generate a random test input combination and execute the function.

createTensor:
	Run command "./setup_createTensor.sh" followed by ./bin/testcreateTensor
	This will generate an executable file(testcreateTensor) which is executed using
	the second command.

readWriteTensorsFromStandardIO:
	Run command "./setup_readWrite.sh" followed by ./bin/testStdIO
	This will generate an executable file(testcreateTensor) which is executed using
	the second command.
	Output results will be stored in a csv file, to verify correct functionality of
	the operation.

convolutionTranspose:
	Run command "./setup_convTranspose.sh" followed by ./bin/convTranpose
	This will generate an executable file(testcreateTensor) which is executed using
	the second command.
	Output results will be stored in a csv file, to verify correct functionality of
	the operation.

unaryOperateOnTensor:
	Run command "./setup_unary_fn.sh" followed by ./bin/app
	This will generate an executable file(app) which is executed using 
	the second command.
	app can be chosen from: (as per the desired test)
		Test_unary_fn
		Test_unary_inplace_fn
		Test_unary_fn_Random
		Test_unary_fn_inplace_Random

genRandomTensor:
    Run command "./setup_genRandomTensor.sh" followed by ./bin/genRandom
	This will generate an executable file(app) which is executed using 
	the second command.
	Output will be printed on command line itself as 2D slices of tensors
