Instructions for compiling tests for different modules

maxPoolOfTensors:
	Run command "./maxPoolOfTensors.sh"
	This will generate a random test input combination and execute the function.

createTensor:
	Run command "./setup_createTensor.sh" followed by ./bin/testcreateTensor
	This will generate an executable file(testcreateTensor) which is executed using
	the second command.

readWriteTensorsFromStandardIO:
	Run command "./setup_readWrite.sh" followed by ./bin/testStdIO
	This will generate an executable file(testcreateTensor) which is executed using
	the second command.
	Output results will be stored in a csv file, to verify correct functionality of
	the operation.

convolutionTranspose:
	Run command "./setup_convTranspose.sh" followed by ./bin/convTranpose
	This will generate an executable file(testcreateTensor) which is executed using
	the second command.
	Output results will be stored in a csv file, to verify correct functionality of
	the operation.

unaryOperateOnTensor:
	Run command "./setup_unary_fn.sh" followed by ./bin/app
	This will generate an executable file(app) which is executed using 
	the second command.
	app can be chosen from: (as per the desired test)
		Test_unary_fn
		Test_unary_inplace_fn
		Test_unary_fn_Random
		Test_unary_fn_inplace_Random

genRandomTensor:
       Run command "./setup_genRandomTensor.sh" followed by ./bin/genRandom
       This will generate an executable file(app) which is executed using 
       the second command.
       Output will be printed on command line itself as 2D slices of tensors
       
zeropad:
	Run command "./setup_zero_pad_tensor.sh" 
	This will generate the executabe file (zero_pad_tensor_test.exe) which is executed
	using the command "./bin/zero_pad_tensor_test"
	Outputs will be printed on the screen of the shell. 
	Which will show from which location the data was read from and to which location 
	the data is written to, is printed for all the elements of the tensor.
	The details about the tensor can be changes from thentest file in "./util/zero_pad_tensor_test.c"
