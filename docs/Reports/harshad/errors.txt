  typo "necessry"
  The entire paragraph should be rewritten.  Use "The processor .. " instead of "Processor ..."
  Do not use "Lets see", instead use "We examine each interface in detail"

  typo "interfce"

  Sentence ".  so this" change to ". So this"  

---------------------------------------------------------------------
page 11 is too causal.. lots of syntax and construction errors.

  Rewrite!

     - new sentence starts with capital
     - don't say "see 2.3 for ..", but "See Section 2.3 for ...."

  Undefined reference "??"
---------------------------------------------------------------------

   typo in 2.2 title
     use "Interface data structures" instead of "Interfaces data structures"

page 14
    see notes on page 11 above.

      Remove sentence "These are all interface decisions taken lets now move on to NIC design."
      Avoid use of "Lets ...." too casual.

	Figure 2.2 Show interface to MAC!!


     Give link to registers file map table in Section 2.3.1
     Put the parser code as part of a Figure.
	Use verbatim environment inside figure to show pseudo code (many places!)

page 17
     undefined reference ??

     What is Table 2.7 "ref file"?

     Section 2.4 is badly written and structured.  Rewrite!

     Section 2.5 what is it...

page 21
	undefined reference ?? (Section 3.3)

Lots of work needed!
