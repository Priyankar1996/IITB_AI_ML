The function maxPoolOfTensors() is used to perform pooling on the input tensor src, and stores the result in dst.

Usage:
void maxPoolOfTensors (Tensor *src, Tensor *dst, int l, int stride, int num_dims_to_pool,int * dims_to_pool, int mode);

Arguments:
	src                -> Input tensor
	dst                -> Output tensor
	l                  -> Length of pooling (pool size)
	stride             -> Stride of pooling
	num_dims_to_pool   -> Number of dimensions to be pooled (a positive integer)
	dims_to_pool       -> Array containing actual dimensions to be pooled
	mode               -> Mode of operation (floor/ceiling)(0/1)

Testbench Usage:
	Ensure that GNU octave is installed on the device.
	If using a device with Windows as the operating system, replace "cmp" on line 81 with "comp".
	Run "gcc Test_maxpool.c -o name_of_executable" on Terminal
	Run "./name_of_executable Test_inputs/inputFileName.txt" on Terminal
	If the output is "If no message is printed after this one, there is no error!!", then the code works.
	Else, there is a bug in the Code/Testbench(including octave code).
