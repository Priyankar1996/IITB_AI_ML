The function maxPoolOfTensors() is used to perform pooling on the input tensor src, and stores the result in dst.

Usage:
void maxPoolOfTensors (Tensor *src, Tensor *dst, int l, int stride, int num_dims_to_pool,int * dims_to_pool, int mode);

Arguments:
	src                -> Input tensor
	dst                -> Output tensor
	l                  -> Length of pooling (pool size)
	stride             -> Stride of pooling
	num_dims_to_pool   -> Number of dimensions to be pooled (a positive integer)
	dims_to_pool       -> Array containing actual dimensions to be pooled
	mode               -> Mode of operation (floor/ceiling)(0/1)

Testbench Usage:
	Ensure that GNU octave is installed on the device.
	If using a device with Windows as the operating system, replace "cmp" on line 81 of Test_maxpool.c with "comp".
	Run "make compile" to compile.
	Run "make run" to run the script.
	Alternatively, use "make all" to both compile and run.
	Enter the filename (must be present in utils/Test_inputs/) in the prompt.
	If the output is "If no message is printed after this one, there is no error!!", then the code works.
	Else, there is a bug in the Code/Testbench(including octave code).
