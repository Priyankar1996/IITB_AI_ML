Documentation will be updated.
I have tried to implement genRandomTensor which generates random numbers of u8, i8, float32, float64 data types and will be extended for other data types. To test there is also a preetyprint function which displays tensor values. Later this can be extended to generate random numbers in some distribution. 

INTERFACE:
void genRandomTensor(uint32_t seed, RngType t, Tensor* result);

Argument RngType can be one of 
	mersenne_Twister
	wichmann_Hill,
	philox,
	combRecursive,
	threefry
This is not explored completely yet. Currently I have borrowed online implementation of mersenne_Twister and rand() of C.
