File names correspond to functions. I had to make changes to tensor.c hence its there so that changes can be compared. 

mtwist.c, mtwist.h are for mersenne Twister PRNG. README_mt and manual mtwist.3 are for mersenne functions. Currently taken from online source. Other RNGs are not complete yet. 
Currently only float32, float64, u8, i8 is supported.
