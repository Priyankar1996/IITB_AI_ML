test_genRandomTensor.c is test file. It includes preliminary createTensor and preetyprint(which prints 2D slices sequentially) functions which can be later brought out if required. I am unsure as to how to test proper correctness of functions. Output seems to be random for u8, i8, float32, float64 as of now. test is binary file. 
To make changes to test input, change the fields of corresping variables at the end of test_genRandomTensor.c
To test, Include paths may need to be changed as required.
