test_genRandomTensor.c is test file. It uses createTensor.c and preetyprint(which prints 2D slices sequentially) functions which can be later brought out if required. I have tested code by printing the generated numbers. 
To make changes to test input, change the fields of corresping variables at the end of test_genRandomTensor.c
To test, Include paths may need to be changed as required.
