NAME 
    scalarOperator - performs point-wise addition or multiplication on Tensor 
    scalarOperator_inplace - inplace version of scalarOperator function

DESCRIPTION
    The scalarOperator (Operator op, Scalar* s, Tensor* src, Tensor* result) function takes in input from user as 2 tensors and the operation to be performed.
    It writes the output in the result Tensor. 
    If dest and src tensor are the same, it reduces to the inplace function.
