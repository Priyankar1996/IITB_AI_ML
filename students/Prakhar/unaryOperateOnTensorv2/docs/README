NAME 
    unaryOperateOnTensor - performs unary operations on Tensor 
    unaryOperateOnTensor_inplace - inplace version of unaryOperateOnTensor function

DESCRIPTION
    The unaryOperateOnTensor(Tensor *src, Tensor* dest, Operation op) function takes in input from user as 2 tensors and the operation to be performed.
    It writes the output in the dest Tensor. 
    If dest and src tensor are the same, it reduces to the inplace function. 
NEW 
    This is the folder for work on unary after updates of using sized_tensor & other changes..
