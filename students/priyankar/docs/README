NAME
    createTensor - creates a Tensor.

DESCRIPTION
    The createTensor() function takes in inputs from the user about the tensor's
    descriptor and allocates space for that in the memory-pool.
    
    One can create all the required tensors initially and fill them with the 
    necessary values later in the code.
