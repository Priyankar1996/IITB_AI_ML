NAME
    createTensor - Contains operations like createTensor(), initialiseTensor(),
                    copyTensor() and destroyTensor().
    readWriteTensorFromStandardIO - Helps to read csv files and store them in a
                    Tensor. Also helps to write back any tensor data into the
                    csv file as well.
    convTranspose - Performs convolutional transpose on tensors.

DESCRIPTION
    The createTensor() function takes in inputs from the user about the tensor's
    descriptor and allocates space for that in the memory-pool.

    readWriteTensorFromStandardIO() helps in reading data from available datasets
    in form of a csv file. It can write back the output data to a csv file as well.

SOME IMPORTANT POINTS
    1. Working with Image Tensors:
        - Always create the tensor in the particular format to store images:
            {height, width, channels}.

        - The csv files stores data in a 2D-array of 
            {height*width, 3}.
