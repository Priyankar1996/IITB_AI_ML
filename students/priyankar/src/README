==================================================================================
Q: How are tensors created?
A:  As you have noticed in other documents that creating a tensor means allocating
    storages in mempool, there is a certain discipline followed while storing them.
    
    It starts off with allocating spaces in the memory-pool.Then the tensor's 
    descriptor is stored at the base address of the tensor and leaves spaces 
    for the elements of the tensor to be filled by other methods.
